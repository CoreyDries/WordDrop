An app for android I created using technologies such as visual studio, c#, and the Xamarin framework.
The concept of the game is for players to drop letter tiles one by one (like in connect 4) to create words (like in scrabble).
The project requires Xamarin software and a trial Xamarin liscense if you wish to build and test the game.
